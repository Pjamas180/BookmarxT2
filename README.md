# BookmarxT2

Bookmarx Application created for Norman Powell's CSE 136 Enterprise Applications class.

The application is designed to allow users to keep track of their favorite sites in one place. They can add, delete, modify and share their Bookmarx with other people!

The class emphasizes the idea of "enterprise" applications, meaning that the application is scalable and secure.
